## Extract the data

- Find the nearest large city

  ```SQL
  SELECT *
  FROM city_list
  WHERE country='United States'
  ```

  Then I found that the large city nearest to Gainesville in FL is Jacksonville.

  - Write a SQL query to extract the city level data. Export to CSV.

    ```sql
    SELECT year, avg_temp
    FROM city_data
    WHERE city='Jacksonville'
    ```

    Then I exported it to a csv file. 

  - Write a SQL query to extract the global data. Export to CSV.

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM global_data
    ```

    

## Line charts of moving averages
- Steps

  - I used python packages pandas and matplotlib to calculate the moving averages and to plot the lines.

  - The key consideration when deciding how to visualize the trends is how to choose the window for averaging. I'd like the curves to be fairly smooth without losing too many details at the same time. Therefore, moving averages over 10 years might be a good choice.

  - The following is the python code I used to calculate the moving averages and plot.

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    def ma(file):
        df = pd.read_csv(file)
        df['10_ma'] = df['avg_temp'].rolling(10).mean()
        df.dropna(inplace=True)
        return df
    
    df_city = ma('city_data.csv')
    df_global = ma('global_data.csv')
    plt.plot(df_city['year'],df_city['10_ma'],label='Jacksonville')
    plt.plot(df_global['year'],df_global['10_ma'],label='Global')
    plt.legend()
    plt.xlabel('Year')
    plt.ylabel('10-year moving averaged temperature (C)')
    ```

- The code above generates the figure below.

## Make observations

  - *Is your city hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average? Has the difference been consistent over time?*

    Jacksonville is consistently hotter than the global average.

- *What does the overall trend look like? Is the world getting hotter or cooler? Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?*

  Overally the worlder is getting hotter. There were a few drops, e.g., in around 1820, but the overal trend is that it's getting hotter.

- *How do the changes in your cityâ€™s temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?*

  The temperatures of both Jacksonville and global average are increasing, and we can see which one is increasing more rapidly by using a linear regression on both of the two datasets. The following code adds trendlines.

  ```python
  import numpy as np
  def trend(df):
      x = df['year']
      y = df['ma']
      z = np.polyfit(x,y,1)
      p = np.poly1d(z)
      print(p)
      plt.plot(x , p(x))
  trend(df_city)  
  trend(df_global)
  ```

  <center><img src=image-20190121151733510.png style="zoom:60%" /><center>

  It also outputs the slopes: 0.003385 for Jacksonville and 0.004572 for the global average. Therefore, the global is getting hotter more rapidly.

- *How correlated are the temperatures of Jacksonville and the global average?*

  We can use the code below to plot the temperature of Jacksonville vs. the global average and also calculate the correlation coefficient.

  ```python
  import statsmodels.formula.api as sm
  df_all = pd.merge(df_city, df_global,left_index=True, right_index=True, how='inner')
  plt.plot(df_all['ma_y'],df_all['ma_x'],'.')
  plt.xlabel('Temp of global')
  plt.ylabel('Temp of Jacksonville')
  result = sm.ols(formula="ma_y ~ ma_x", data=df_all).fit()
  print(result.summary())
  ```

  We obtained $r^2 \approx 0.38$. This means a moderate positive correlation.
