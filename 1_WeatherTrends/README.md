# Exploring Weather Trends

In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.

## Dataset

Temperatures of cities all over the world starting from 1850s.

## Project Details

- Extract the data from the database. 
- Create a line chart that compares my city’s temperatures with the global temperatures. Plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable.
- Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and my city’s averages, as well as overall trends.
  - Is my city hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average? Has the difference been consistent over time?
  - How do the changes in my city’s temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?
  - What does the overall trend look like? Is the world getting hotter or cooler? Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?
  - How correlated are the temperatures of my city and the global average?
